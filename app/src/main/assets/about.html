    <p>This is an open-source white-label android app to check in to a venue using a QR code and cellphone number for COVID contact tracing and to allow authorities to contact visitors in case of a possible exposure.</p>
    <p>The aim of this white-label app is to be forked, ant then themed and customized by governments or localities according to their needs to speed up the website checkin process and to avoid long wait lines to enter places and to diminish COVID spread.</p>
    <p>The process of the app is inspired and built upon the Attendance Record of the Government of Mexico City (CDMX) and was developed independently and unofficially.</p>
    <h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>
    <p>This app was developed independently and without relation to any government or institution.</p>
    <p>For demonstration purposes, the app implements an unofficial connection to Mexico City Attende Record by simulating the manual process on the website and it may change and stop working any time. It’s not meant to be used as an official substitute for official mechanisms. Use for testing purposes and under your responsibility.</p>
